# Robot-Control-Web-Interface

# Description
This project focuses on creating a web-based control interface for a robot's movement and integrating it with a database to track commands. The system consists of two main tasks:

## Task 1: Control Page Implementation
* Control Page (index.html):
** Provides a user-friendly interface with directional buttons (forward, backward, left, right, stop).
** Sends commands to the server using fetch() in JavaScript.
  
* Server-side Handling (move.php):
** Receives commands via POST requests.
** Stores commands in a MySQL database (robot_controller).
